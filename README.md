# Structural-Dynamics-Visualizer
This python script utilizes the Tkinter Python package to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to simulate a single-degree of freedom (SDOF) structure subject to initial conditions or periodic loading.

In order to run this script, you must have Python and its TKinter package downloaded. To download Python, you can go https://www.python.org/downloads/.

After you download Python and this script, all you need to do is run the script and a GUI will appear on your screen. Input your name into the box to learn more about
the project. Next, click on the "SDOF Visualizer" tab and input the properties for your structure such as stiffness, mass, viscous damping coefficient, etc.
Finally, you may press the "Run Visualizer" button and a plot will appear that will display the displacement of the structure numerically and visually over time.
